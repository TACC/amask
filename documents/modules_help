Execute amask_omp, amask_mpi, or amask_hybrid (found in the \$TACC_AMASK_BIN
directory) in a parallel environment to display the masks that
the processes will have (process = OMP thread or MPI task here). E.g.

STAND-ALONE BINARIES

      export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16
      export OMP_PROC_BIN=close
      amask_omp
      ./my_omp_application

      ibrun amask_mpi                     # non-TACC sites may use mpirun
      ibrun ./my_mpi_application

      export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
      export OMP_PROC_BIN=spread
      ibrun amask_hybrid                  # non-TACC sites may use mpirun
      ibrun ./my_hybrid_application

Application code can be instrumented to report the masks within an application.
The C/C++ functions are argumentless, and have the same names as the stand-alone
executables.  Similarly, for the corresponding Fortran subroutines.  E.g.

INSTRUMENTATION FUNCTIONS   ( compile with \$TACC_AMASK_LIB/amask.a)

  ...
  #pragma omp parallel     // Pure OpenMP code
  amask_omp();
  ...

  ...
  MPI_Init(NULL,NULL);    // Pure MPI code
    amask_mpi();
  ...
  MPI_Finalize();


  ...
  MPI_Init(NULL,NULL);    // Hybrid code
  ...
     #pragma omp parallel
     amask_hybrid();
  ...
  MPI_Finalize();
  ...

A full description of the options can be found in the pdf file located
in \$TACC_AMASK_DOC.  The syntax and usage can be found by executing any
one of the stand-alone executables with the -u (usage) and -h (help) options.
